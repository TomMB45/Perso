# BDD_Fraisse 
## The project 
database project for the 5th year of engineering school. The subject of the project:
- Create a database from scratch using SQL
- The database should enable the user to : 
    - Anticipate the risk of the appearance of an invasive species (plant/parasite) by knowing the main imports/exports of plants between countries
    - Get all-country transportation of a given plant
    - Getting all the species could be invasive in a given country
    - Get all the species that could be invasive in a given country and that are transported by a given country
    - Know if a quarantine time can prevent an invasion in a given country
    - Know if a country has already been invaded by a given species
    - Transport could have steps (max 3) and for each stop, we consider 1 day of stop. 
    - Consider that the parasite could reduce the life duration of the plant 
    - Update transportation table

## Bonus
- implementation of a random test system for each query
