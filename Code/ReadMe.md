                - Create a database from scratch using SQL
                - The database should enable the user to : 
                    - Anticipate the risk of the appearance of an invasive species (plant/parasite) by knowing the main imports/exports of plants between countries
                    - Get all-country transportation of a given plant
                    - Getting all the species could be invasive in a given country
                    - Get all the species that could be invasive in a given country and that are transported by a given country
                    - Know if a quarantine time can prevent an invasion in a given country
                    - Know if a country has already been invaded by a given species
                    - Transport could have steps (max 3) and for each stop, we consider 1 day of stop. 
                    - Consider that the parasite could reduce the life duration of the plant 
                    - Update transportation table

                - Bonus
                    - implementation of a random test system for each query

- Side_project folder
    * Contains some python code for a side project I did for fun. 
        1. First one is a data analysis of the of COVID data provided by the government. Using ML and AI to predict the evolution of the pandemic in France, and show the time evolution on a gif. Forecastig, clustering, data visualization, etc.

        2. Second one is project I do for my girlfriend birthday, iIt's a visualisation of our trip in Roma using google maps data. Using networkx and matplotlib to show the evolution of our trip on a map, parsing of json file to get the data, etc.

- Codewars folder 
    * Contains some python code for codewars challenges. I did it for fun, to learn python and to improve my algorithmic skills. File are sorted by difficulty (1_kyu is the hardest, 8_kyu is the easiest)
